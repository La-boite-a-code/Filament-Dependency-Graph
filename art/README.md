# Art

Marketing assets for the [Filament plugin directory](https://filamentphp.com/plugins).

| File | Size | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `banner.jpg` | 2560 x 1440 | Main image (16:9, at least 2560 x 1440) |
| `thumbnail.jpg` | 1920 x 1080 | Tighter crop for the plugins list (16:9, at least 1280 x 720) |

Both are rendered from the matching `.html` files, so they can be regenerated
after a design or wording change:

```bash
chrome="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"

"$chrome" --headless=new --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
    --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1280,720 \
    --screenshot=banner.png "file://$PWD/banner.html"

"$chrome" --headless=new --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
    --force-device-scale-factor=1.5 --window-size=1280,720 \
    --screenshot=thumbnail.png "file://$PWD/thumbnail.html"

sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 90 banner.png --out banner.jpg
sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 90 thumbnail.png --out thumbnail.jpg
```

The pages are laid out at 1280 x 720 CSS pixels; the device scale factor is
what brings them up to the required resolution.

Headline font: [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi). The graph
mock-up mirrors the real page with the product's node shapes and colors -
indigo panels, teal resource hexagons, gray model boxes, the dashed fuchsia
polymorphic diamond, the amber selection ring and the floating inspector.
Indigo is the accent used in the headline. Same layout system as the
`filament-business-hours` and `filament-logs-explorer` banners so the plugins
read as a family.

This folder is `export-ignore`d, so it is not shipped in the Composer package.
